# Logistic Regression applied on the Iris Dataset

The dataset was aquired from https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris <br>
---
**Pre-processing** <br>
- A header was added to the data file to classify all the datapoints it contained.
- The output values / expected output values were mapped to numerical values for indexing
<br>

**Performance Metrics** <br>
- Overall, the precision of the model is 97%.
- There are some mislabled items but that is expected as the dataset is small and the model is a very elementary one.
